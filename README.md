Cook fast with what you already have. MinuteMeals matches your pantry to **10–15 minute** recipes, shows what you can cook **now**, and (optionally) builds a shopping list for missing items.  
> **JS-only**. Mobile + Web via Expo. Future backend: **Node.js + SQL/MongoDB**.

## 1. Project Title
**MinuteMeals — Pantry-Based Quick Recipes App**

---

## 2. Name & Roll Number
**Pranay Chitare — 2024-B-16102004**

---

## 3. Problem Statement
People waste time deciding what to cook and often skip simple meals they could make with ingredients already at home. Typical recipe apps assume you have everything and don’t reflect your **actual pantry**.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A **React Native + Expo** app (JS) that:
- Lets users select what’s in their **pantry** (or scan the fridge in future),
- Instantly matches **cookable recipes** within 10–15 minutes,
- Shows **missing items** and creates an **optional shopping list**,
- Works **offline** with a small recipe dataset, and **scales** later via Node.js + DB.

---

## 5. Key Features
- ✅ Pantry picker (search + checkboxes)  
- ✅ Instant match: **Cook Now** or **Missing items (required/optional)**  
- ✅ One-tap **Add to Shopping List** (merge quantities)  
- ✅ Filters: veg/non-veg • max time • cuisine • difficulty  
- ✅ Favorites & shareable recipe cards  
- ✅ Offline-first with local `recipes.json` (Web + Mobile)

<details>
<summary><b>How Matching Works (tap to expand)</b></summary>

- Compare user pantry keys (lowercased) with each recipe’s ingredients.  
- Count **required vs optional** missing items.  
- Return recipes where `missingRequired ≤ maxMissing` and `minutes ≤ maxTime`.  
- Sort by `missingRequired ↑` then `minutes ↑`.

</details>

## 6. Target Users / Audience
Students, working professionals, hostels/PGs, busy families—anyone who wants **fast, simple** home-cooking.

---

## 7. Technology Stack
**Now (JavaScript only):**
- React Native + **Expo** (Android • iOS • Web)
- Expo SQLite, Expo Image/FileSystem, Expo Share/Notifications
- Simple state via Context or Zustand (optional)

**Future (Backend & CV):**
- **Node.js** (Express)  
- **DB:** MySQL (Prisma) **or** MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- Storage: S3/GCS for images  
- **Fridge Scan (optional):** Google Vision / AWS Rekognition / Azure Vision

---

## 8. Expected Outcome
- Suggest suitable recipes in **< 1s** for a pantry of 20–50 items  
- Clear **Cook Now** vs **Missing items** decisions  
- Simple shopping list flow; favorites & sharing

---

## 9. Timeline (Optional)
- **Week 1–2:** UI/UX, pantry, local `recipes.json`, matching  
- **Week 3–4:** favorites, shopping list, filters, web build  
- **Week 5–6:** Node API + DB sync, auth (optional)  
- **Week 7:** camera fridge scan + testing

---

## 10. Additional Notes (Optional)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/Pranay44444/MInuteMeals  
- **License:** MIT  
- Use a **synonyms table** to normalize detections (e.g., “bell pepper” → “capsicum”).  
- Multilingual ingredient names help reach more users.
