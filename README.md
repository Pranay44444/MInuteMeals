Cook fast with what you already have. MinuteMeals matches your pantry to **10‚Äì15 minute** recipes, shows what you can cook **now**, and (optionally) builds a shopping list for missing items.  
> **JS-only**. Mobile + Web via Expo. Future backend: **Node.js + SQL**.

## 1. Project Title
**MinuteMeals ‚Äî Pantry-Based Quick Recipes App**

---

## 2. Name & Roll Number
**Pranay Chitare ‚Äî 2024-B-16102004**

---

## 3. Problem Statement
People waste time deciding what to cook and often skip simple meals they could make with ingredients already at home. Typical recipe apps assume you have everything and don‚Äôt reflect your **actual pantry**.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A **React Native + Expo** app (JS) that:
- Lets users select what‚Äôs in their **pantry** (or scan the fridge in future),
- Instantly matches **cookable recipes** within 10‚Äì15 minutes,
- Shows **missing items** and creates an **optional shopping list**,
- Works **offline** with a small recipe dataset, and **scales** later via Node.js + DB.

---

## 5. Key Features
- ‚úÖ Pantry picker (search + checkboxes)  
- ‚úÖ Instant match: **Cook Now** or **Missing items (required/optional)**  
- ‚úÖ One-tap **Add to Shopping List** (merge quantities)  
- ‚úÖ Filters: veg/non-veg ‚Ä¢ max time ‚Ä¢ cuisine ‚Ä¢ difficulty  
- ‚úÖ Favorites & shareable recipe cards  
- ‚úÖ Offline-first with local `recipes.json` (Web + Mobile)

<details>
<summary><b>How Matching Works (tap to expand)</b></summary>

- Compare user pantry keys (lowercased) with each recipe‚Äôs ingredients.  
- Count **required vs optional** missing items.  
- Return recipes where `missingRequired ‚â§ maxMissing` and `minutes ‚â§ maxTime`.  
- Sort by `missingRequired ‚Üë` then `minutes ‚Üë`.

</details>

## 6. Target Users / Audience
Students, working professionals, hostels/PGs, busy families‚Äîanyone who wants **fast, simple** home-cooking.

---

## 7. Technology Stack
**Now (JavaScript only):**
- React Native + **Expo** (Android ‚Ä¢ iOS ‚Ä¢ Web)

**Future (Backend & CV):**
- **Node.js** (Express)  
- **DB:** MySQL (Prisma)  
- Storage: S3/GCS for images  
- **Fridge Scan (optional):** Google Vision / AWS Rekognition / Azure Vision

---

## 8. Expected Outcome
- Suggest suitable recipes in **less than 1sec**
- Clear **Cook Now** vs **Missing items** decisions  
- Simple shopping list flow; favorites & sharing

---

## 9. Timeline (Optional)
- **Week 1‚Äì2:** UI/UX, pantry, local `recipes.json`, matching  
- **Week 3‚Äì4:** favorites, shopping list, filters, web build  
- **Week 5‚Äì6:** Node API + DB sync, auth (optional)  
- **Week 7:** camera fridge scan + testing
